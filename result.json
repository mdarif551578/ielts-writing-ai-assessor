            "justification": "The response generally addresses the task, presenting a clear agreement with the statement. While the main ideas are relevant, the development lacks depth and specific details, falling short of a fully convincing argument. The response meets most parts of the question, but the examples are not as fully explored as they could be, limiting the overall impact. It includes relevant reasons and examples from the candidate's knowledge but lacks the extended analysis seen in higher bands. The position is clear throughout. However, the support and illustrations could be more substantial. This fits Band 6 because it 'generally addresses the task' but has some points that 'may lack full development.' The essay does not fully meet Band 7 due to minor omissions in the development of examples.",

            "justification": "The response demonstrates coherent progression with clear organization. Paragraphing is adequate, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion. Cohesive devices, such as 'to begin with,' 'as,' and 'so,' are used effectively, but often mechanically, leading to a lack of natural flow. Referencing could be improved to avoid some repetition. While the ideas are logically presented, the overall flow could be smoother with more sophisticated transitions. It fulfills the Band 6 criterion of 'coherent progression' but uses 'effective but mechanical' devices and some 'repetition.' The connections between ideas are sometimes superficial. This limits it from reaching Band 7 because the cohesive devices are not flexible and contain inaccuracies or overuse.",

However, the range is somewhat limited, and there is a reliance on basic vocabulary. Some errors occur but rarely impede communication. There's a mix of appropriate and less precise word choices ('vital aspect' instead of 'essential'). It generally meets the Band 6 descriptor of 'adequate vocabulary' and 'meaning is clear,' despite a limited range.

Errors occur but rarely impede communication. There is a good attempt at using a variety of structures, but grammatical errors occasionally cause minor confusion. The response matches Band 6's 'mix of simple and complex structures' and 'errors rarely impede meaning.' The grammatical range exists but needs refinement.
